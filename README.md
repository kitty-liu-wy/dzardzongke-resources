Dzardzongke is a Tibetic language spoken in Nepal. This repository hosts information and materials relating to typing Dzardzongke, including the orthography and Keyman keyboard materials. 

**Keyboard**

The Dzardzongke keyboard can be downloaded from the Keyman website, and will also be uploaded from this repository. The keyboard can be used on both computers and on mobile devices. In both cases, you need to first download the Keyman app appropriate for your device. 

After installling the Dzardzongke keyboard on a mobile device, you can also download a lexical model that lets you type with predictive text. Download the FILE NAME file, tap the 'share' button, and open it in the Keyman application. Then, in the general Settings app on your device, you should be able to add Keyman to your device's list of input sources.

This lexical model only takes orthography into account, and not the frequencies of individual words in Dzardzongke. It is based on a wordlist of Dzardzongke compiled by Marieke Meelen (University of Cambridge) from her fieldwork.

**Information**

Our orthography for Dzardzongke was developed by Marieke Meelen (University of Cambridge) and Charles Ramble (Paris EPHE), based on their fieldwork with and learnings from the Dzardzongke community.
