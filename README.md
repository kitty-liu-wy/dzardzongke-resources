Dzardzongke is a Tibetic language spoken in Nepal. This repository hosts information and materials relating to typing Dzardzongke, including the orthography and Keyman keyboard materials. 


**Keyboard**

The Dzardzongke keyboard can be downloaded from the Keyman website, and will also be uploaded from this repository. The keyboard can be used on both computers and on mobile devices. In both cases, you need to first download the Keyman app appropriate for your device. 


**Predictive texting on mobile devices**

After installling the Dzardzongke keyboard on a mobile device, you can also download a 'lexical model' that lets you type with predictive text. See 'lexical model' folder.


**Information**

Our orthography for Dzardzongke was developed by Marieke Meelen (University of Cambridge) and Charles Ramble (Paris EPHE), based on their fieldwork with and learnings from the Dzardzongke community.

The keyboard and lexical model have been made by Kitty Liu (University of Cambridge) through Keyman Developer.
