Dzardzongke is a Tibetic language spoken in Nepal. This repository hosts information and materials relating to typing Dzardzongke, including the orthography and Keyman keyboard materials. 


**Keyboard**

The Dzardzongke keyboard can be downloaded from the Keyman website, and will also be uploaded from this repository. The keyboard can be used on both computers and on mobile devices. In both cases, you need to first download the Keyman app appropriate for your device. 


**Predictive texting on mobile devices**

After installling the Dzardzongke keyboard on a mobile device, you can also download a 'lexical model' that lets you type with predictive text. 

Files:
tbq-latn-np.dzardzongke-no-freq.model - the current Dzardzongke predictive text model. This lexical model only takes orthography into account, and not the frequencies of individual words in Dzardzongke. It is based on a wordlist of Dzardzongke compiled by Marieke Meelen (University of Cambridge) from her fieldwork.

The model comes in a .kmp version and a .js version. The .kmp file is the one you can download and install thorugh the Keyman app. The .js version is uploaded for reference. 

Installing lexical models on your mobile device:
1. Make sure you have downloaded the mobile Keyman app, and installed the Dzardzongke Keyman keyboard through it.
2. Download the .kmp version of the lexical model.
3. Open the file - it will probably display as a blank file. Tap the 'share' button, and select Open In > Keyman.
4. This should take you to the Keyman app. Follow the steps to install.
5. Go to Settings on your device, and find the page for adding keyboards / input methods, where you can add Keyman to your device's list of keyboards.


**Information**

Our orthography for Dzardzongke was developed by Marieke Meelen (University of Cambridge) and Charles Ramble (Paris EPHE), based on their fieldwork with and learnings from the Dzardzongke community.

The keyboard and lexical model have been made by Kitty Liu (University of Cambridge) through Keyman Developer.
