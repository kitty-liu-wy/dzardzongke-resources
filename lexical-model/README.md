```tbq-latn-np.dzardzongke-no-freq.model``` - the current Dzardzongke predictive text model. This lexical model only takes orthography into account, and not the frequencies of individual words in Dzardzongke. It is based on a wordlist of Dzardzongke compiled by Marieke Meelen (University of Cambridge) from her fieldwork.

The model comes in a ```.kmp``` version and a ```.js``` version. You should be able to install the model by downloading the ```.kmp``` file and following the instructions below, but try the ```.js``` version if that doesn't work. 


**Installing lexical models on your mobile device:**

1. Make sure you have downloaded the mobile Keyman app, and installed the Dzardzongke Keyman keyboard through it.
2. Download the ```.kmp``` version of the lexical model.
3. Open the file - it will probably display as a blank file. Tap the 'share' button, and select Open In > Keyman.
4. This should take you to the Keyman app. Follow the steps to install.
5. Go to Settings on your device, and find the page for adding keyboards / input methods, where you can add Keyman to your device's list of keyboards.
